I’m a **15-year-old student software developer** who loves building things that actually do stuff — not just tutorials.

I work across **Python projects** ranging from games and word solvers to logic-based tools, simulations, and basic ML-style programs. I enjoy taking concepts from **math, physics, and computer science** and turning them into interactive, visual, or problem-solving code.

### Some of my projects include:
- 🎮 Game logic (Rock–Paper–Scissors, Wordle solver)
- 🧠 Intelligent tools (Animal Guesser, Spam & Sentiment Analyzer)
- 🛠️ Utilities (Dictionary lookup, Word unscrambler)
- 🌡️ Simulations & modelling (Temperature Gradient visualizer)

I’m especially interested in **problem-solving, numerical thinking, and building systems from scratch**. I like understanding *why* something works, not just making it work.

Currently learning, experimenting, and shipping small projects — **one script at a time**.
